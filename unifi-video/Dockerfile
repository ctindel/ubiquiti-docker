# We are installing mongodb 3.2 here so that the wiredtiger storage
#  engine will get used by default.  Unifi Video starts mongod with 
#  the --smallfiles option, which is a config that is only relevant 
#  for mmapv1 storage engine.  We end up with a log that says 
#  "Detected configuration for non-active storage engine mmapv1 when 
#  current storage engine is wiredTiger" but it seems to be harmless.  
#  Still, would be nice to be able to override the mongod options.
#
# We need to run the unifi-video script once because it sets up all the 
#  /var/lib/unifi and /usr/lib/unifi symlinks for us.  But we don't
#  want to keep any of that data around, we want our union mount to
#  replace /var/lib/unifi so we remove a bunch of dirs at the end.
